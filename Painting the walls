You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing the costs and the time taken to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

A paid painter that paints the ith wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of money.
A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied.
Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.

 

Example 1:

Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. 
Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 3 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 2 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 1 and 2, free of cost in 2 units of time. 
Thus, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4.
